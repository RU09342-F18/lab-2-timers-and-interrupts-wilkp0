# Button Interrupt
The button interrupt is identical to the first lab but uses an interrupt to toggle the LED. To do this the output LED was initialized as well as the pull/up resistor for the button. Interrupt was enabled using P1IE so port 1 and then selects a BIT or the button to interrupt. Before running code the interrupt flags must be cleared. Using #pragma vector=PORT1_VECTOR__interrupt void Port_1(void) which initializes the interrupt for the button press. The bit then toggles when button is pressed and the flags are cleared.
