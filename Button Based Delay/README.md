# Button Based Delay

The LED was set to an output, the button to an input, and an interrupt for the button was initialized. When using the ACLK this line of code must be present BCSCTL3 = LFXT1S_2;.TA0CTL = TASSEL_1 + MC_1 enabled the clock and set it to count up. TA0CCR0 was set to 5000. The first interrupt used was to tell for how lonf the button was pressed and how long was it released for. These values were counnted using the TA0R which count right away after the button is pressed. From this the an equation was used to calculate CCR0. WHen the timer reached CCR0 the LED toggled and the count incremented. Make sure to toglle both the x and high low edge to keep checking their values.
